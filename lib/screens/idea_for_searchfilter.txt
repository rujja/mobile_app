myList = [
    'ram', 'shyam', 'sita', 'hari', 'hanuman', 'laaxman', 'mahesh', 'shiva',
]
mySearchList = myList
search = 'ram'

mySearchList = ['ram']

search = 'shyam'

mySearchList = ['shyam']


// first we tried search function using where with condition == (takes exact same value only)
// solution --> used where with contains in condition in the list ( takes any aplhabet in the entered value)
// when we tried uppercase the result was not shown
// solution --> we converted each string value to lowercase or uppercase

// when we tried to filter or search in myList the resulted  new list  replaced old myList
// this made re-search in new myList which had lesser data
// to solve this problem we introduced new state mySearchList
// mySearchList stores filtered data whereas myList contains all data
// so whenever we want to search we search from myList and the filtered data is placed in mySearchList


// when we tried to delete the filtered data the delete action flopped
// (when we tried to delete element it was only removed in myList but not in mySearchList{UI})
//slution-->  after delete we did re-search from  new myList
